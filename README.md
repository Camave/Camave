# 👋 Hi, I'm Camille!

I'm a Computer Engineering student at **Polytechnique Montréal**, passionate about **artificial intelligence**, **software development**, and **building smart tools that automate or simplify everyday tasks**.

I love experimenting with code — whether it’s designing my own neural network from scratch, developing a mini GPT model, or creating mobile applications that connect people for local services.  
I enjoy turning ideas into tangible projects that combine **creativity, logic, and impact**.
